-
### 5. Responsibilities

NA

-
### 6. Materials and Equipment

  6.1 A GitHub account is required

-
### 7. Procedure

Example scenario – A new SPA has been created and is being loaded into GitHub as a User Page.  The SPA was created via 'ng build --prod --aot'.  The GitHub account being used is ‘mysite’ and the page will be presented as mysite.github.io

  7.1   Log into the GitHub account

  7.2   Create a new Repository

  7.3   Enter the repository name ‘accountName.github.io’.  This name format must be used in order for the User Page to work as expected.

  7.4	Select ‘Public’

  7.5	Select ‘Initialize this repository with a README’

  7.6	Click ‘Create Repository’

  7.7	On your workstation, execute ‘git clone’ with the repository web URL
  
    Recommed: When executing git clone, include your account name in the URL, i.e. mysite@github.com.  If this is done, step 7.10 will be unnecessary.

  7.8	Switch to the cloned directory

  7.9   Copy the SPA files to the new directory

  7.10  Modify '.git/config' so the URL includes your GitHub account

  7.11  Execute ‘git add .’

  7.12  Execute 'git commit-a –m "<Your comments here>"'
  
  7.13  Execute ‘git push –u origin master’

The SPA will now be available at ‘https://‘accountName.github.io’
