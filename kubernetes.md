Container - A system process

Docker - Here are my strong opinions on how you should build containment around your system process so it can best be isolated from other running proceses and from the host

Image - I will not depend on the host, I will bring all my dependencies with me

Kubernetes - I've got a lot of images, I think I need a bit of help managing them

You thought I was a SysAdmin.  Well, I was replaced by a script, sorta.  But, it's all good, k8s is way more interesting
